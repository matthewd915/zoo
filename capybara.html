        Capybaras, native to South America, are the largest rodents in the world. 
        They can grow up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 140 pounds. 
        Furthermore, they enjoy basking in water and often times will hang out in wetlands, rivers, and lakes. 
        Since they have webbed feet, they're naturally great at swimming! 
        Capybaras are very calm and friendly, usually living in groups. 
        In fact, they're so chill that they'll even interact with other species! 
        Capybaras are herbivores, so they eat grasses, plants, and fruit.
