        Flamingos are tall birds with bright pink feathers. 
        They're often found in shallow lakes and wetlands. 
        They mainly feel on algae, crustaceans, and plankton and their diet is actually what fuels their distinct, pink color. 
        Flamingos are social and are usually in large groups in which they engage with each other. 
        Their beaks serve as a way to filter food from the salty, alkaline environments that they get their water from.
