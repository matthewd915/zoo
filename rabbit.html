        Rabbits are small animals, renowned for their long ears and hops. 
        Rabbits can be found all over the world and are herbivores, eating mainly just grass, leaves, and carrots! 
        They are great at burrowing and make tunnel systems known as warrens, which actually protect them from their predators. 
        Another distinct thing about rabbits is their high reproductive rates. 
        Rabbits are often preyed upon, so they have keen instincts and senses to help them stay out of trouble. 
        In modern times, many people decide to keep rabbits as pets due to their friendly nature and low maintenance.
