            Jellyfish inhabit the ocean and have been around for over 500 million years, making them one of the oldest living creatures. 
            Jellyfish are actually 95% water and lack a brain, heart, and bones. 
            Despite this, they still remain in a bell-shaped structure. 
            Their tentacles contain many cells called nematocysts, which they use to string their prey and fend off from their predators. 
            Although they may be scary, most species are harmless to humans minus a few exceptions.
